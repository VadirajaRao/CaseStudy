Case study for System Software and Compiler Design

The "LA.py" program does the lexical analysis of a program that has been written in "program.c".

The file "result.c" is used to store the intermediate program, that is generated by removing blank spaces and comment lines. "result.c" is used to simplify the code in order to search for the necessary patterns easily.
